# nodejs-express-mongo-boilerplate
A boilerplate for a node.js with express and mongose 

- first you need to execute 
```console
npm i
``` 

then you need to customize the **package.json** file to hold your application data 
- name
- description
- author

As far as you've started configuring your data you'll need to config your development and testing db connections 
in the **./config/db.json**

You'll find examples for routes, controllers and models.

The boilerplate got weponized with middlewares for uploading, authintication and authorization.

Also configuered with **JSDoc** for documenting and **Mocha** for testing

As long as you here enjoy the ride 😅 🙏🏻 [Kidding]
